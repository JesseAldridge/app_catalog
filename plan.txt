What is the purpose?
I want to have a catalog of applications.
Each application will be hosted.
Each application will be open source.
Non technical people will be able to look through the collection.
They will be able to find functionality close to what they want.
They will use that as a starting point.
Possibly in the future this catalog will be an interface for describing the software you want.
And then the app could search for code modules that satisfy that expectation.

Does something else have higher priority?
No

What is the first step?  second?
Build a simple list of web apps
Build each simple web app in the list

How are you going to test this?
Will use it myself

How is this going to work in production?
Users will have some vague idea of an application they want built.
They will search for it in the catalog.
They will click a button to host it as-is.
Or they will download the code.
If they don't know how to code they would need to hand off to a developer at this point.
Maybe I could be that developer.

How can we divide up the work?
I can do it

What are the input formats?
http requests

What are the output formats?
a list of apps
along with a description
and maybe a gif or a screenshot
hosted apps in the cloud
downloadable source code

Is this change going to break existing processes?
no existing process

Is there an easier way?  (avoid coding)
There are existing app catalogs... can I use those?
Dentist -- non technical users can't use that
Hire a developer -- expensive

Is it worth it?
Will potentially allow non technical people to get started writing code
So yeah maybe

Can I adapt something that already exists?
Doing that by finding open source code snippets

Do I have enough time to see it through to completion?
Yeah

Can I preempt any blockers?
No blockers

Is there anyone I can ask for advice?
Talk to Heberth
Will anyone actually use this?
Will probably have to start by consulting
Upwork?
Startup School board?

What are the risks?
No one wants it
Who would want a collection of barely useful software?
Talk to Alan
Build for myself at first

How can we track usage?
nodejs logs

Make sure everyone knows what they are doing
just me

How are we going to integrate with other systems?
host each app myself
other than that it's just a simple web page

Are there concurrency issues?
not that i can think of

How could this be done faster?
could pay someone to build it
lame and expensive

Do you know what all the terms mean?
yeah

What are the edge cases?
will discover that as I add more functionality

Can you enable ops to drive the content?
no ops

Are any significant events coming up?
not really

Get design reviewed
no one to review

Is product ok with the plan?
no product team

Create a diagram
done

Are we following the spec exactly?
no spec

Do I have a fast feedback loop?
yeah

Is anyone else working on the same thing?
no

Is this legal?
yes

Metric?
revenue
will want people to pay for software
pay packages as well as free packages
